# 3D Space Visualization of Research Topics in Data Visualization over the years

## Data Collection

All articles used in this project were collected from the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) open catalogue of research works. After reducing the dataset to a usable form, embeddings were generated using TD-IDF, and then clustered using HBDSCAN after a dimensional reduction using UMAP. The dataset is currently static, and is thus a snapshot of data visualization research papers collected in November 17, 2025.

## Visualization Technology

Three.js was used to create the space visualization

## Future Work

Currently there are plenty of visual design elements and interactions considered  for future developments. We also believe the addition of sound effects may make this visualiation a more immersive experience.
